MAX9709 50W, Filterless, Spread-Spectrum, Stereo/Mono, Class D Amplifier
This is my MAX9709 amplifier project, started at 2009. Made my own PCB to evaluate the Class-D audio amplifier IC. 

I've built and tested my amplifier that time and it works. Recently redesigned it, made a smaller PCB. However not yet tested due to lack of resources.
I have bare PCBs to sell.
